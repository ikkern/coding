**Problem:**
Create a Python program that suggests an activity based on the day of the week.

**Instructions:**
1. Ask the user to enter the current day of the week (e.g., "Monday", "Tuesday").
2. Store the day in a variable.
3. Use conditional statements to recommend an activity based on the day.
    - If the day is "Monday", print: `"Start your week with a workout!"`
    - If the day is "Tuesday", print: `"It's a great day to read a book!"`
    - If the day is "Wednesday", print: `"Mid-week movie night!"`
    - If the day is "Thursday", print: `"Try a new recipe!"`
    - If the day is "Friday", print: `"Relax and enjoy the weekend!"`
    - If the day is "Saturday", print: `"Go for a hike!"`
    - If the day is "Sunday", print: `"Prepare for the week ahead with some self-care."`

**Example Output:**
```python
Enter the day of the week: Friday
Relax and enjoy the weekend!
