**Problem:**
Write a Python program that asks the user for the current temperature and suggests whether they should wear a jacket, short-sleeves, or stay indoors.

**Instructions:**
1. Ask the user to enter the current temperature (in Celsius).
2. Store the temperature in a variable.
3. Use conditional statements to give advice based on the temperature.
    - If the temperature is below 10째C, print: `"It's cold outside. Wear a jacket!"`
    - If the temperature is between 10째C and 25째C, print: `"It's a nice day. Wear short-sleeves!"`
    - If the temperature is above 25째C, print: `"It's hot outside. Stay cool!"`

**Example Output:**
```python
Enter the temperature: 15
It's a nice day. Wear short-sleeves!
