**Problem:**
Write a Python program that checks if a person is eligible to vote based on their age.

**Instructions:**
1. Ask the user to enter their age.
2. Store the age in a variable.
3. Use conditional statements to check if the person is eligible to vote.
    - If the age is 18 or older, print: `"You are eligible to vote!"`
    - If the age is under 18, print: `"Sorry, you are not eligible to vote yet."`

**Example Output:**
```python
Enter your age: 20
You are eligible to vote!
