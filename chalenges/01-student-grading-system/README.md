**Problem:**
Create a Python program that asks for a student's score and then provides a grade based on the score.

**Instructions:**
1. Ask the user to enter their score (out of 100).
2. Store the score in a variable.
3. Use conditional statements to print the grade based on the score.
    - If the score is greater than or equal to 90, print: `"Grade: A"`
    - If the score is between 80 and 89, print: `"Grade: B"`
    - If the score is between 70 and 79, print: `"Grade: C"`
    - If the score is between 60 and 69, print: `"Grade: D"`
    - If the score is below 60, print: `"Grade: F"`

**Example Output:**
```python
Enter your score: 85
Grade: B
```

Pseudocode Example: 
Student Grading System
Start
Prompt the user to enter their score (out of 100).
Store the score in a variable called score.
If the score is greater than or equal to 90:
Print "Grade: A"
Else if the score is between 80 and 89 (inclusive):
Print "Grade: B"
Else if the score is between 70 and 79 (inclusive):
Print "Grade: C"
Else if the score is between 60 and 69 (inclusive):
Print "Grade: D"
Else (if the score is below 60):
Print "Grade: F"
End
